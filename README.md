# Conway-s-Game-of-Life

In the Conway's Game of Life, every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

a)Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
b)Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
c)Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
d)Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction. 

It is a cellular automation where its evolution is determined by its initial state
